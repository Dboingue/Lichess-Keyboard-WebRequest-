# Lichess-Keyboard-WebRequest-
Using WebRequest API to implement Lichess keyboard play

An example of Chrome WebRequest API to redirect website's files to a custom file (same as local overrides, but customizable and persistent).

This version is not stable, because the original file gets updated regularly, and therefore some updates are incompatible with the extension.

The use is similar to this extension: 
https://github.com/Sentero-esp12/Lichess-Keyboard-Input

You have to set keys manually (line 6492) in code.js.

To install, download the repository, go to Chrome Extensions, and load the unziped extension (developer mode should be on).

Use these settings:

Or view html files in the repository, 
otherwise the extension won't work.
